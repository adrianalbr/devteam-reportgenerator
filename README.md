# devteam-reportgenerator

## Objective
The objective of this application to generate a software engineering team generator command line application.

The application prompts the user for information about the team's manager and team members. Team members could be any number of engineers and interns. Once the user is done entering the team members the application creates an HTML file that displays a team roaster with the information provided by the user.

## How to install
The application is initiated by running node app.js

## How does it work
The user runs node app.js and is prompted with a series of questions starting with the manager and information related to the manager. Then the user is prompted to enter other team members if necessary, the options are engineers and interns and information related to them.
Once the user is done entering team members the application generates an HTML with the team roaster

## Credits
The application uses the inquirer to prompt the user for answers, and Jest for testing.
